# This is the global configuration file for the testdrive(1) utility.

# CACHE is the directory to cache the ISOs and disk images
# Default: $HOME/.cache/testdrive
#CACHE = /path/to/your/cache

# CACHE_IMG and CACHE_ISO will default to $CACHE/img and $CACHE/iso, respectively.
# You can set them explicitly if you want (specially interesting if you are
# trying to run the image off /dev/shm.  Make sure you have enough space there!!!
#CACHE_IMG = /dev/shm

# CLEAN_IMG will remove the just-generated image at the end of run. By default the image
# is kept, unless nothing was changed (i.e., the disk image was created, but no installation
# was actually tried).
# If running the image off /dev/shm, then *by default* the image will be removed (memory is a
# restricted resource, and we should not over-allocate it)
#CLEAN_IMG = False

# VIRT can be either 'kvm', 'virtualbox', or 'parallels'

# MEM is the amount of memory in MB to give to the VM guest
# Default: 384

# SMP is the number of processors to give to the VM guest if
# running in KVM.
# Default is the number of CPUs in the host
#SMP = 1

# DISK_FILE is the full path to the disk image
# Default: $CACHE/$ISO.img
#DISK_FILE = /path/to/foo.img

# DISK_SIZE is the size of the disk image
# Note that this will be a sparse, qcow2 file, so it should not actually
# take that much space on the filesystem.
# Default: 6G
DISK_SIZE = 6G
#DISK_SIZE = 10G

# KVM_ARGS is a string of arbitrary KVM_ARGS to use when launching the VM
# See kvm(1) for a comprehensive list of arguments
